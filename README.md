# Odd One Out 

_by Katia Liashevska_

## Description of the project

The Odd One Out game is the first project I created during my 2023 Ironhack bootcamp in full-stack web development. 
I came up with this idea because I wanted to create a game that wasn't a big classic and hasn't been seen too many times before. The goal was to make something good-looking and easy to play with a spotless logic behind.

## Tech stack

This game was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

- Random HSL colors assigned to the circles on each round
- One of the circles per round has a slightly different lightness and this difference increases progressively
- The amount of circles per round increases too to make things more difficult
- The progress bar and the level pill are constantly updated to let you know how far you are in the game 
- You win if you get past level 30, in any case you get your score at the end
